/*
Values and Variables
------------------------
1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and
assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
2. Log their values to the console
 */


/*
Data Types
------------------------
1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
country. The variable should hold a Boolean value. Also declare a variable
'language', but don't assign it any value yet
2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
to the console
 */

/*
let, const and var
--------------------------
1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some
countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never
change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens
 */


/*
Basic Operators
-----------------------------------
1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
then how many people would live in each half?
2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
Finland?
4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
have less people than the average country?
5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
people speak portuguese'
*/

/*
  Write an expression that uses at least three, different, arithmetic operators
  to log the number 42 to the console.

/*
  The Celsius-to-Fahrenheit formula:
     F = C x 1.8 + 32

  1. Set the fahrenheit variable to the correct value using the celsius variable and the forumla above
  2. Log the fahrenheit variable to the console
 */

/*
Strings and Template Literals
----------------------------------
1. Recreate the 'description' variable from the last assignment, this time
using the template literal syntax
 */

/*
Build a single string that resembles exactly the following (Each string should be printed on its own line).

1. 'Why couldn't the shoes go out and play?
They were all "tied" up!'

2. 'Blowing from the west
Fallen leaves gather
In the east.'
 */


/*
Fix the right side expression so it evaluates to true.
let answer = "ALL Strings are CrEaTeD equal" == "All STRINGS are CrEaTED Equal";
 */

/*
Create a variable called bill and assign it the result of 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15 (don't perform the calculation yourself, let JavaScript do it!).
Next, create a variable called tip and assign it the result of multiplying bill by a 15% tip rate.
Finally, add the bill and tip together and store it into a variable called total.

Print the total to the JavaScript console.

Hint: 15% in decimal form is written as 0.15_._

TIP: To print out the total with a dollar sign ( $ ) use string concatenation. To round total up by two decimal points use the toFixed() method.
To use toFixed() pass it the number of decimal points you want to use. For example, if total equals 3.9860, then total.toFixed(2) would return 3.99.

/*
Mad Libs is a word game where players have fun substituting words for blanks in a story.

"The Intro to JavaScript course is __________. James and Julia are so __________. I cannot wait to work through the rest of this __________ content!"

  1. Declare a madLib variable
  2. Use the adjective1, adjective2, and adjective3 variables to set the madLib variable to the message:

  'The Intro to JavaScript course is amazing. James and Julia are so fun. I cannot wait to work through the rest of this entertaining content!'
 */



/*
 * Programming Quiz: One Awesome Message

  1. Create the following variables:
      - firstName
      - interest
      - hobby
  2. Create a variable named awesomeMessage and set it to an awesome message using
      string concatenation and the variables above.
  3. Log the awesomeMessage variable to the console.

  Notes:
  - The `awesomeMessage` should have the format of:
    Hi, my name is _____. I love _____. In my spare time, I like to _______.

  - Using the above as an example, firstName would have been assigned to "Julia",
    interest to "cats", and hobby to "play video games" to produce the message:
    Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games.

  - Be sure to include spaces and periods where necessary!
